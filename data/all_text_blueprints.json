  "tip_laser": "Tip: Each laser shot will be blocked by a single shield bubble, regardless of the laser's damage.",
  "tip_light_laser": "Tip: Light Lasers do no system or crew damage but reload fast, making them useful at suppressing shields.",
  "tip_frost": "Tip: Frost weapons lock down rooms and briefly stun crew that they hit on top of doing more damage to them. These properties makes these weapons valuable for impeding enemy movements.",
  "tip_laser_bio": "Tip: This Laser cannot pierce any shields nor do any damage to hull or systems, but it is very efficient at killing crew.",
  "tip_sniper": "Tip: It's a sniper. In space. GO WILD!",
  "tip_ion": "Tip: For every one point of ion damage, one power bar is removed from the target system and it is then locked for 5 seconds, preventing re-powering. If an ion weapon hits shields, the damage is automatically applied to the Shield System.",
  "tip_ion_fire": "Tip: Fire ions act much like any ordinary ion, but start fires in the room they hit. If they hit while the shields are still up, they will not start a fire.",
  "tip_ion_bio": "Tip: Rad ions act much like any ordinary ion and weaken crew that are hit for 10 seconds. Afflicted crew will move and repair 66% slower, and will be stunned 75% longer. If they hit while the shields are still up, they will not do extra crew damage, but will still apply the debuff to any crew in the Shields room.",
  "tip_ion_stun": "Tip: Along with typical ion effects, Stunners temporarily stun crew in the rooms they hit. If they hit while the shields are still up, the stun will be applied to whoever is in the Shield room.",
  "tip_phase": "Tip: Phasers pierce all shield layers. They will do ion damage for the first shield layer pierced, plus additional damage to whatever system they hit.",
  "tip_ancient_plasma": "Tip: Plasma weapons are specialized Ancient ions that do both ion and system damage. If a plasma projectile hits the shields of an enemy, it will both ion AND damage their shields.",
  "tip_energy": "Tip: Energy weapons are very versatile as they can do both ion and hull damage, but do not damage crew or systems.",
  "tip_chain_energy": "Tip: The Chain Energy decreases its cooldown every time it fires. Check the green lights on the weapon to see how many times it has fired.",
  "tip_missiles": "Tip: Missiles will ignore all enemy shields, but cost one missile to launch. Enemy defense drones will shoot down incoming missiles.",
  "tip_missiles_recycler": "Tip: This weapon is equipped with Recycler technology, removing its ammo cost, while still granting the usual benefits of Launchers or Bombs. However, it suffers from a longer cooldown as a result, and can only fire a limited number of times during a single fight.",
  "tip_missiles_heavy": "Tip: Heavy missiles always carry hull-bust attributes, making them great for dealing hull damage, but can also be used to quickly take down systems instead if necessary.",
  "tip_missiles_burst": "Tip: Burst missiles replicate multiple warheads which each do 1 damage. You will only need 1 missile to fire them.",
  "tip_missiles_cloak": "Tip: Missiles shot by this Launcher cannot be targeted by solid-targeting defense drones. However, projectile-targeting defense drones can still intercept them.",
  "tip_mine": "Tip: Mine Launchers do no system damage, but have reasonable status effect chances and fire salvos of slow moving mines which pierce all shields. Decent for spreading chaos.",
  "tip_kernel": "Tip: Kernels function much like missiles, but have a moderate chance to ignore their ammo cost with each volley.",
  "tip_kernel_elite": "Tip: Elite Kernels are stronger variants of Kernel weapons. They have an increased chance to ignore their ammo cost and have a guaranteed stun chance.",
  "tip_spore": "Tip: Spores function much like bombs, but have a small chance to ignore their ammo cost with each volley.",
  "tip_spore_elite": "Tip: Elite Spores are stronger variants of Spore weapons. They have an increased chance to ignore their ammo cost and cripple crew, preventing them from healing from passive sources and halving their repair speed for 15 seconds.",
  "tip_chain_beam": "Tip: Chain Beams decrease their cooldown every time they fire. Check the green lights on the weapon to see how many times it has fired.",
  "tip_breach_beam": "Tip: The Breach Beam can create a breach on every tile it hits, and can also pierce a shield layer!",
  "tip_mining_beam": "Tip: The Mining Beam pierces one shield layer. Each layer after that will block the effects of the weapon.",
  "tip_pierce_beam": "Tip: This Phase Beam pierces two shield layers, which means it will not lose any damage for the first two shield bubbles it pierces. Each layer after that will reduce damage by one.",
  "tip_crew_beam": "Tip: This Anti-Bio Beam does no hull damage, so it cannot pierce any amount of shields. It also won't be as effective on drones.",
  "tip_stun_beam": "Tip: This Neural Beam does no hull damage, and only has partial piercing. It also won't be as effective on drones.",
  "tip_beam_repair": "Tip: This weapon repairs the enemy hull, but not their systems. Useful in conjunction with hull damaging weapons to pull off miraculous crew kills!",
  "tip_focus": "Tip: Pinpoints are specialized Beams that strike a single spot instead of doing a sweep. Just like Beams, their damage is reduced by 1 for each shield layer pierced.",
  "tip_particle_laser": "Tip: Particle accelerators fire in a radius much like Flak. Each projectile does small system damage and has a reasonable fire chance. They cannot lower shields, but can go through Super Shields if no regular layers of shields are present besides them.",
  "tip_particle_missiles": "Tip: Particle missiles are much more accurate than the accelerator variants, but only fire one projectile. In addition to piercing shields as other missiles do, they can even penetrate Super Shields.",
  "tip_particle_beam": "Tip: The Particle Beam does no hull or crew damage, nor can it pierce shields. However, once shields are down it can do heavy damage to systems and light fires.",
  "tip_sentry": "Tip: At the cost of a missile, deployment cannons will create sentries in a room, which provide various effects inside and sap the power of any system in it. Sentries last in the targeted room for a fixed time duration, and cannot be destroyed before they expire.",
  "tip_scanner": "Tip: Scanners are small, incredibly cheap equipment that do no damage of any kind but can temporarily reveal rooms on either your or the enemy ship.",
  "tip_bombuff": "Tip: Like Heal Bombs, these do not affect ships in any way, but rather apply effects on your own crew, and only your own.",
  "tip_zolt_deleter": "Tip: Using this Beam to damage or kill any crew type other than Zoltans is illegal and punishable by death.",
  "tip_conservative": "Tip: Conservative weapons feed off of power leaks in a system, so they don't need to use any power themselves. Consequently, they take longer to charge and require power allocated in the system itself to function. They cannot charge while the weapon system is unpowered.",
  "tip_battery": "Tip: Battery weapons provide power to the weapons in the slots to the right of them, allowing you to go past the system's normal power limits.",
  "tip_bio": "Tip: Radiation weapons deal significant crew damage and weaken crew that are hit for 10 seconds. Afflicted targets will move and repair 66% slower, and will be stunned 75% longer.",
  "tip_madness": "Tip: Madness will prevent the use of active abilities of afflicted crew for 25 seconds. Be careful, because it can affect your own crew too!",
  "tip_clone_cannon": "Tip: Weeeeeee!",
  "tip_salt": "Tip: A weapon from a forgotten era and a forgotten race. Useful for any kind of murder.",
  "tip_mantis": "Tip: A dated weapon originating from a conflict embedded in history. Excellent to harass and murder enemy crew.",
  "tip_crystal_elite": "Tip: Elite Crystal weaponry are stronger variants of Crystal weapons. They can pierce through two layers of shields, and apply a lockdown to targeted rooms.",
  "tip_old": "Tip: Old weapons are rusty and have much worse aim.",
  "tip_ancient": "Tip: The powerful tech of the long forgotten Obelisk race, now in your hands at last.",
  "tip_ancient_wreck": "Tip: These weapons are forged from Aether, the exotic and extremely valuable alloy found exclusively in ancient ruins. They are very powerful, but time has not been kind to this weapon. Because of the damage, it will function worse than you suspect it once did.",
  "tip_defunct": "could not find mu_TIP_DEFUNCT",
  "tip_adapter": "Tip: Adaptive weapons increase in damage each time they are fired. The damage increase amount and limit depends on the weapon.",
  "tip_preemptive": "Tip: Pre-emptive weapons can only be fired once per fight, and charge near-instantly. They use no power, but much like Conservative weapons require power to be in the weapon room.",

In close coordination with the new king, you overtook both the Rebellion and Federation, and established a new galactic Slug order that will stand the test of time... for about a decade, before it falls because thieves don't know how to run an economy properly.",
  "credit_victory_slug_beans": "Somehow, you have revolutionized the Slug government through a can of beans. In close coordination with Bean Sylvan, you overtook both the Rebellion and Federation, and established a new galactic Slug order that will stand the test of time... for about a decade, before it falls because most people don't accept beans as a legitimate ruler.",
  "credit_victory_slug_orchid": "As soon as you leave, events immediately kick into motion. Quan uses the power of Strawberries to assume control of the Kleptocracy, all others being powerless before the might of the chaotic weapon. Quan travels to the Gathering and offers his fleet and an alliance. The Gathering begins mass producing these new weapons. Shortly after that, the Slug-Floral alliance dominates the galaxy, the Rebels are destroyed and the Federation is taken as a trophy. King Quan considers you a hero, at least.",
  "credit_victory_chaos": "As you continue on your quest, by the time you reach Node 17 the Flagship has already been 'destroyed'. Warped beyond comprehension, the twisted hull of the vessel soon slips out of existence entirely. It seems the Federation has won - and you aren't sure how to feel about it.",
  "credit_victory_true_bomb": "Congratulations, you've completed the True Ending to FTL: Multiverse! Though this is the end to the story, obviously there's always more runs to be had. We hope you've enjoyed the mod so far!",
  "credit_victory_true_save": "Congratulations, you've completed the True Ending to FTL: Multiverse! Though this is the end to the story, obviously there's always more runs to be had. We hope you've enjoyed the mod so far!",
  "credit_victory_true_mutual": "With the MFK Flagship and your vessel destroyed, the Paragon was lost in slipspace never to be found again. Though the Obelisk Empire soon collapsed, the Rebellion remained in power, soon replacing Vance's leadership.",
  "credit_victory_nexus_good_save": "Shortly after the death of Prime, the C.E.L. reorganized with a new council of leadership. The Prime cluster, your home, was finally incorporated after millennia of disclusion, with you standing as representative. A new era of peaceful order in the Multiverse began, but with Her still alive somewhere out there, it's uncertain for how long it can remain...",
  "credit_victory_nexus_good_kill": "Shortly after the death of Prime, the C.E.L. fell into shambles with too few of its previous members left to organize it. Prime's empire collapsed, and a new era of disorder took the Multiverse by hold. With Her still alive but having vanished, new agents of chaos spread across realities, destroying many. Even your own cluster began its exodus, spreading the Multiversal War to new Federations and Rebellions, ensuring its eternity forevermore.",
  "credit_victory_nexus_bad_save": "Following your demise and the destruction of the C.E.L., Her evil spread outwards, reclaiming all of its past territory. The inhabitants of your cluster were killed near instantaneously, spared the same pain that all else whom She corrupts will endure for eternity.",
  "credit_victory_nexus_bad_kill": "With Her power over the Nexus cemented, the last few survivors of the C.E.L. attempt to flee but are quickly snuffed out along with their clusters. Your original mission is quickly forgotten as you accept your place at side of Her, serving her faithfully for eternity.",
  "credit_victory_nexus_her": "Power unmatched, She returns to the Nexus and eradicates the remaining forces of the C.E.L., including yourself. A new dark empire descends on the Multiverse, spreading madness through the infinite expanse of the cosmos for eternity.",
  "credit_victory_nexus_her_good": "The powers of Her, once again divided, are destroyed to prevent her evil from ever being released again. The C.E.L. reorganizes, trying new methods of leadership in the absence of Prime. As for you and your crew, you take a long and well deserved vacation in some remote reality offered to you. In time, perhaps your cluster will be assimilated into the Nexus, with you as ambassador - but that's all for the future.",

  "tip_beams": "Tip: For every shield bar on the enemy, a beam's damage is reduced by one. For example, a three damage beam against two shield bars will cause one damage in every room it hits.",
  "tip_bombs": "Tip: Bombs teleport past shields and defense drones to land directly on the ship. Like missiles, they cost one missile to launch. They never damage hull, but can be effective at disrupting crew and systems. You can even launch them at boarders on your own ship.",
  "tip_chain_ion": "Tip: The Chain Ion increases its damage every time it filres. Check the green lights on the weapon to see how many times it has fired.",
  "tip_chain_laser": "Tip: Chain lasers decrease their cooldown every time they fire. Check the green lights on the weapon to see how many times it has fired.",
  "tip_charge": "Tip: Charge weapons can be charged multiple times to generate more firepower. You can save time and fire the weapon prematurely but it will have fewer shots ready as a result.",
  "tip_crystal": "Tip: Crystal weapons pierce a single layer of shields. Only level 2 shields and higher can stop them.",
  "tip_fire_beam": "Tip: This fire beam does no hull damage, so it cannot pierce any amount of shields.",
  "tip_flak": "Tip: Flak weapons target an area instead of a single room. This loss of accuracy means more firepower and speed than their laser counterparts.",
  "tip_hull": "Tip: Hull weapons deal double damage if they hit a room that does not have a system or a subsystem."
